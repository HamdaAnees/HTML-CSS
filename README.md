            <p>Our world is filled with indescribable beauty and places to go, both human-made and natural, and it’s hard to say whether a single lifetime would indeed be enough to experience all of it. Most of us will probably never see everything that the world has to offer us, but it’s worth a shot!
                Some consider travel to be a luxury or even an unnecessary burden, while others believe it to be vitally important to living a fulfilled life. Still, others don’t even have the opportunity to make that decision. But if you are afflicted with a case of wanderlust, you know that seeing the most beautiful places to visit can be a profoundly moving and valuable experience.
                It’s a wonderful and beautiful world we live in, so make sure to check these places to visit before you die! Here’s an excellent quote from St. Augustine that will hopefully inspire you to choose a place to visit before you die and just go: 
                <centre>“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.”</centre>
